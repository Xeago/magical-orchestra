# Magical Orchestra

Welcome to Lyndsey and Julia's Magical Orchestra!

## Usage

```
lein run
```

Overtone takes a long time to start for some reason, so you will have
to do some waiting.

Then go to `http://localhost:8080/server/client.html` and play music!

Then send other people to `http://your-ip:8080/server/client.html` and 
have THEM play music.
